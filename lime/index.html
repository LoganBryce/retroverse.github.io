        <h2 id="whats-lime">What is Lime?</h2>
        <p>
          Lime is a game engine made with the LÃ–VE2D framework. It is designed to be fast, flexible
          and easy to use. It is built using a superset of ECS called Jungle and a superset of
          MoonScript called MoonShine.
        </p>
        <h2 id="why-use-lime">Why use Lime?</h2>
        <p>
          It is easy to setup thanks to its template system and it includes everything you need
          to get started without wasting time setting up libraries. It also includes a language
          designed with speed in mind that helps you turn your ideas into code with less hassle.
        </p>
        <h2 id="whats-moonshine">What's MoonShine?</h2>
        <p>
          MoonScript is superset of Lua and MoonShine in a superset of MoonScript that aims to add functionality and make the language
          more familiar for people coming from other languages.

        <h2 id="whats-jungle">What's a Jungle?</h2>
        <p>
          Jungle is a similiar system to an Entity Component System However it has some slight differences,
          the elements of a jungle are below.
          <ul>
            <li><code>Species</code>
              <p>
                Species are like classes of components. They have behaviours and are instantiated to create
                entities. Most entities are created by a helper function created by the user. An example species is
                a player.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><code>Behaviours</code>
              <p>
                Behaviours are functionality and are found on species. They have events which run on entities
                at certain times, namely <code>Spawn</code>, <code>Update</code> &amp; <code>Draw</code>. An example behaviour
                is movement.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><code>Entities</code>
              <p>Entities Are runtime instances of species. For example, if a pig is a species, then a single pig in your game is an entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>Operations</code>
              <p>
                Operations are methods which are run on all entities that have a particular behaviour. An example operation
                is a draw call where you want to organise sprites based on their depth.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-species-included">What Species are Included?</h2>
        <p>
          Some basic behaviours that are included and are also easily modifiable,
          many implement the engines libraries.
          <ul>
            <li><code>movement</code>
              <p>Allows you to control an entity with keyboard, joysticks or controllers.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>physics</code>
              <p>Simple drop physics, no gravity implemented but easily extensible.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>physics-anim</code>
              <p>Update sprite based on last input and speed.</p>
            </li>
            <li><code>sprite</code>
              <p>
                Render an image at a sprites position, required for enitity to have an associated
                position.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><code>sprite-states</code>
              <p>Allows multiple sprites to be easily switched between. i.e <code>run</code> or <code>idle</code>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
